## Maximum Amount of Gold
You are given a set of bars of gold and your goal is to take as much gold as possible into
your bag. There is just one copy of each bar and for each bar you can either take it or not
(hence you cannot take a fraction of a bar).

Given 𝑛 gold bars, find the maximum weight of gold that fits into a bag of capacity 𝑊.

### Input Format
The first line of the input contains the capacity 𝑊 of a knapsack and the number 𝑛 of bars
of gold. The next line contains 𝑛 integers 𝑤0,𝑤1, . . . ,𝑤𝑛−1 defining the weights of the bars of gold.

### Output Format
Output the maximum weight of gold that fits into a knapsack of capacity 𝑊.
